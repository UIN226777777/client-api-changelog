# Shipito Client Account API
You have to send "X-token" header in every request, otherwise you'll get error 403 - {"code": 9, "message":"Invalid token, please provide correct token in header X-token"}

You should receive value for this token in email with registration.
First request you have to send is /api/v1/authenticate, it will generate cookie for you with valid session.

If you send an unauthenticated request to any other url but /api/v1/authenticate, you receive error 401 - {"code": 10, "message": "Authentication needed."}

Base url for all requests is https://client-api.shipito.com/

Example in PHP https://github.com/Shipito/client-api-example
